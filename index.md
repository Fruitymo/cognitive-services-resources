# Cognitive Services Resources
Resources to help you get started with Microsoft Cognitive Services

## What you will need
1. Microsoft Azure Subscription [(create one for free)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
2. Teachable Spirit üôÇ

## Background

 Azure Cognitive Services brings AI within reach of every developer through a family of APIs that don‚Äôt require machine-learning expertise. In this session, Lebogang will give you an overview of the many APIs available under the Microsoft Cognitive Services umbrella, and a demonstration of how Cognitive Services enables you to add advanced AI functionality, such as vision, speech, search, and text services with only a few lines of code for modern application development.

 ## Demos where Cognitive Services is applied
 *Play around with the below resources to see how you can use Cognitive Services in your applications*

 1. [Face Detection Demo](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/#demo) using Face API 
 2. Azure Media Services [Video Indexer](https://www.videoindexer.ai/media/library) *please adhear to privacy rules*
 3. [Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic)](https://studio.azureml.net/) *(guest access available)* - Great Data Science Resource
 3. Knowledge mining demo [Wolters Kluwer Document Demo](http://wolterskluwereap.azurewebsites.net/) by [Wolters Kluwer](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en), a global provider of professional information, software solutions, and services for clinicians, nurses, accountants, lawyers, and tax, finance, audit, risk, compliance, and regulatory sectors.
 4. Visit [AI Lab](https://www.ailab.microsoft.com/) to learn about breakthrough AI innovations

 ## Get Started
 Lots of resources available [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/solutions/), below is what I often emphasise for use at hackathons
 
 1. Build a web bot using [QnA maker](https://www.qnamaker.ai/)
 2. Working with large datasets? Consider [Knowledge mining](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/solutions/knowledge-mining/#products), works with both structured and unstructured data.

 ## Book recommendations
 1. [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html) - This is the textbook for the Foundations of Data Science class at UC Berkeley. Really great examples that can be used as a firm data science foundation. See my [code repo](https://github.com/Fruitymo/learn-data-science-method) and download the Jupyter Notebook on the exercises, output included.
